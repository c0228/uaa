    <div className="mtop15p mbot15p">Handling datasets larger than memory requires specialized techniques. External memory 
        algorithms like External Merge Sort help efficiently process large files. Streaming algorithms, such as 
        HyperLogLog, approximate solutions with minimal memory usage. When data is too large for a single machine, 
        distributed processing with frameworks like Apache Spark enables efficient computation.<br/><br/>
        By implementing these techniques in Node.js, Java, and Python, we can effectively manage large-scale data 
        processing while optimizing performance.</div>
