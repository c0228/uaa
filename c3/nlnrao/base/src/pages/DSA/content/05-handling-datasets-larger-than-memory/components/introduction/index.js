    <div><i>In modern computing, handling datasets larger than available memory is a significant challenge. 
        Traditional in-memory algorithms and data structures become inefficient or outright unusable when datasets 
        exceed RAM capacity. To overcome these limitations, developers use external memory algorithms, streaming 
        techniques, and distributed processing frameworks.<br/><br/>
        This blog explores the strategies, data structures, and algorithms to handle large datasets efficiently. 
        We provide examples in Node.js, Java, and Python to illustrate practical implementations.</i></div>
