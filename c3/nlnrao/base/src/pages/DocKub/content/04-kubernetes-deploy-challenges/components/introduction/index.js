    <div><i>Edge computing is revolutionizing how data is processed and managed by bringing computation closer to the data 
        source. Unlike traditional cloud computing, which relies on centralized data centers, edge computing minimizes latency 
        and enhances real-time processing. Kubernetes, the leading container orchestration platform, is increasingly being 
        adapted for edge environments. However, deploying and managing Kubernetes at the edge introduces unique challenges, 
        including resource constraints and network connectivity issues. In this blog, we will explore how Kubernetes is used 
        in edge computing, the challenges it presents, and how solutions like KubeEdge and MicroK8s address these challenges.</i></div>

    <div className="mtop15p">Kubernetes provides a powerful mechanism for orchestrating containers at scale, ensuring 
        reliability, scalability, and automation. At the edge, Kubernetes is leveraged for:</div>

        <ol>
            <li className="mtop15p"><b>Application Deployment:</b> Kubernetes allows seamless deployment and management of 
                applications across multiple edge nodes.</li>
            <li className="mtop15p"><b>Scalability:</b> It enables horizontal scaling of applications to meet varying workload demands.</li>
            <li className="mtop15p"><b>Fault Tolerance:</b> Kubernetes ensures service availability even if an edge node fails.</li>
            <li className="mtop15p"><b>Resource Efficiency:</b> It optimizes CPU, memory, and storage resources across edge devices.</li>
            <li className="mtop15p"><b>Network Management:</b> Kubernetes manages service discovery and load balancing for distributed applications.</li>
