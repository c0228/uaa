    <div className="mbot15p"><i>Serverless computing has transformed how applications are deployed and managed, offering developers an efficient 
        way to run code without worrying about infrastructure. While traditional serverless platforms often rely on 
        function-based execution, integrating serverless paradigms with Docker containers provides greater flexibility, 
        security, and portability. In this blog, we explore how serverless computing can be applied to Docker containers, 
        discussing its benefits, challenges, and key technologies like Firecracker and Kata Containers.</i></div>

    <div align="center" className="mtop15p"><h2 className="blog-head"><b>Understanding Serverless Computing</b></h2></div>
    <div>Serverless computing, also known as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), allows developers to execute code in response to 
        events without managing servers. Cloud providers allocate resources dynamically, ensuring optimal performance and 
        cost efficiency. While FaaS typically focuses on executing lightweight functions, modern serverless architectures 
        increasingly support containerized applications, bridging the gap between traditional and serverless deployments.</div>

    <div align="center" className="mtop15p"><h2 className="blog-head"><b>Why Use Docker Containers in Serverless Computing?</b></h2></div>
    <div>Docker containers offer an isolated, portable, and lightweight runtime for applications. When combined with 
        serverless computing, they provide several advantages:</div>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Portability –</b> Containers encapsulate dependencies, making it easy to run applications across different 
                environments.</li>
            <li><b>Fast Scaling –</b> Serverless platforms dynamically scale containers based on demand, optimizing resource 
                usage.</li>
            <li><b>Security –</b> Containers provide process isolation, reducing risks associated with multi-tenant environments.</li>
            <li><b>Flexible Runtime –</b> Unlike function-based serverless models, containerized applications can support 
                various languages, frameworks, and dependencies.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
