    <div><i>Apache Kafka is a powerful distributed event streaming platform widely used for real-time data processing, 
        messaging, and event-driven architectures. One of its core capabilities is handling massive amounts of data 
        efficiently. However, as organizations scale their Kafka usage, maintaining compatibility between producers and 
        consumers becomes a challenge.<br/><br/>
        Message format evolution is crucial for ensuring backward and forward compatibility in a Kafka-based ecosystem. 
        This blog explores how Kafka's message format has evolved, the impact of serialization formats like Avro, Protobuf, 
        and JSON, and how schema evolution is managed in distributed environments.</i></div>
