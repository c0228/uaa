    <div><i>Security is a critical aspect of any application, and with the increasing complexity of software systems, integrating 
        security testing into the development lifecycle is essential. Spring Boot, being a widely used framework for developing 
        Java-based applications, offers various ways to embed security testing methodologies like penetration testing, static 
        code analysis, and real-time security monitoring. This blog explores how to seamlessly integrate security testing into 
        the Spring Boot lifecycle and leverage various tools and practices to monitor and respond to security incidents in 
        real-time.</i></div>
