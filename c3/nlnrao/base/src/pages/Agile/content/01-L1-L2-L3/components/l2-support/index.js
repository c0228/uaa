                <div>Issues escalated from L1 to L2 support are typically addressed promptly, with escalation occurring within a 
                    predefined timeframe outlined in SLAs. This timeframe may range from a few hours to one business day, depending 
                    on the severity and impact of the issue.</div>
                <div><b>Example:</b> L1 support escalates an issue related to network connectivity issues affecting multiple users. 
                L2 support receives the escalation and begins investigating within 2 hours.</div>

            <li className="mtop15p">
              <div><b>Resolution Time (1-3 business days)</b></div>
              <div>L2 support aims to provide comprehensive resolutions for escalated issues within a reasonable timeframe, often 
                within one to three business days. Complex problems may require additional investigation, testing, and coordination 
                with other teams, resulting in longer resolution times.</div>
              <div><b>Example:</b> A recurring software crash issue is escalated to L2 support. They conduct in-depth analysis, identify a 
                configuration conflict, and implement a solution within 2 business days</div></li>
