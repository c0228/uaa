            Architecture design principles are fundamental guidelines that govern the way software systems are designed and constructed. 
            These principles provide a framework for making decisions about the structure, behavior, and interaction of various components 
            within a system. Agile methodology, on the other hand, is a project management approach that emphasizes flexibility, 
            collaboration, and iterative development. While it may seem that agile and architecture design principles are at odds with 
            each other, they can actually complement each other quite well when implemented thoughtfully.

            Architecture design principles encompass a broad range of guidelines and best practices that inform the design and construction of 
            software systems. The principles that are commonly considered:

                        <div><b>Modularity</b></div>
                        <div>This principle advocates breaking down a system into smaller, manageable modules or components. Each module 
                        should have well-defined boundaries and responsibilities, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain. 
                        Modularity promotes reusability and flexibility within the system.</div>

                            <div><b>Incremental Delivery</b></div>
                            <div>Agile methodology emphasizes incremental delivery of working software in short iterations or sprints. 
                                This aligns well with the modularity principle, as each iteration focuses on delivering a set of features 
                                or user stories as independent modules. By breaking down the system into manageable increments, Agile teams 
                                can apply modularity principles to design and develop components that can be independently developed, 
                                tested, and integrated.</div>

                        <div>Abstraction involves hiding implementation details behind well-defined interfaces. By abstracting away 
                            complexity, developers can focus on high-level concepts and functionality without getting bogged down in 
                            the specifics of how things work internally. Abstraction promotes simplicity and reduces dependencies 
                            within the system.</div>

                            <div>Agile encourages emergent design, where architecture evolves incrementally based on feedback and 
                                learning from each iteration. Abstraction principles support this by allowing teams to focus on 
                                high-level concepts and interfaces without getting bogged down in implementation details. As the 
                                system evolves, abstraction facilitates refactoring and restructuring to accommodate changing 
                                requirements while preserving overall architecture integrity.</div>

                        <div>Scalability refers to the ability of a system to handle increasing loads and users without sacrificing 
                            performance. Scalable architectures can adapt to growing demands by adding resources such as servers or 
                            scaling horizontally across multiple nodes. Scalability is essential for ensuring that a system can grow 
                            with the needs of the business.</div>

                                principles align with this by enabling architectures to scale incrementally in response to evolving 
                                needs. Agile teams can plan and prioritize features based on scalability considerations, ensuring that 
                                the architecture can grow with the business and handle increasing loads or user volumes.</div>
