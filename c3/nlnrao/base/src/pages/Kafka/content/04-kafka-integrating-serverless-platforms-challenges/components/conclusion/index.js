    <div className="mbot15p">Integrating Apache Kafka with serverless platforms like AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions 
        offers significant advantages in terms of scalability, cost savings, and simplified infrastructure management. However, 
        challenges such as cold starts, message ordering, and high-throughput handling must be addressed with best practices and 
        architectural strategies. By leveraging Kafka consumers, event bridges, and HTTP integrations, serverless functions 
        can efficiently process streaming data and drive real-time applications.<br/><br/>
        By understanding these integration challenges and opportunities, developers can build robust, event-driven architectures 
        that harness the full potential of Kafka and serverless computing.</div>
