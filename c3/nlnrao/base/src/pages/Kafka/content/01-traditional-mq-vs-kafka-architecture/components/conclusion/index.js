    <div className="mtop15p mbot15p">Kafka and traditional message queues serve different purposes, and choosing between them 
        depends on your specific requirements. Kafka excels in scalability and fault tolerance, making it ideal for 
        distributed event streaming. Traditional message queues, on the other hand, provide strict ordering and reliable 
        delivery for transactional workloads. Understanding their architectural differences ensures the best fit for your 
        messaging needs.</div>
