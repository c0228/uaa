    <div className="mtop15p mbot15p">Encrypting data at rest and in transit in a Kafka cluster is crucial for protecting 
        sensitive information from unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with security standards. Implementing 
        best practices such as filesystem encryption, SSL/TLS, secure key management, and performance optimizations will 
        help achieve a secure and efficient Kafka deployment. By balancing security and performance, organizations can 
        leverage Kafkaâ€™s capabilities without compromising data protection.</div>
