    <div className="mtop15p">Crypto bridges play a vital role in the blockchain ecosystem by enabling interoperability and 
        liquidity movement across networks. However, they also pose security and centralization risks that need to be 
        mitigated. As technology advances, decentralized, trustless bridges will dominate the industry, ensuring a more 
        interconnected and efficient blockchain future.</div>
