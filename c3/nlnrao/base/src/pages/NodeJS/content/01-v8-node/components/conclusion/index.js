    <div className="mtop15p mbot15p">Node.js and the V8 engine work together to provide a high-performance, scalable, and efficient 
        environment for executing JavaScript outside the browser. V8, developed by Google, is responsible for compiling JavaScript 
        into highly optimized machine code, ensuring fast execution. Node.js extends V8 by adding essential features like an 
        event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, allowing developers to build asynchronous and scalable applications efficiently.<br/><br/>
        By leveraging V8’s Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and Node.js’s event loop and libuv, this combination powers modern web 
        servers, microservices, and real-time applications. Their seamless integration makes Node.js a preferred choice for backend 
        development, offering both speed and scalability.</div>
