    <div className="mtop15p mbot15p">Memory leaks in Node.js can lead to severe performance issues, but with the right strategies, they 
        can be detected and prevented. Using profiling tools, memory snapshots, and garbage collection tuning, developers can 
        ensure their applications run efficiently in production. By following best practices such as limiting cache size, properly 
        handling event listeners, and monitoring heap usage, memory leaks can be significantly minimized.<br/><br/>
        A well-optimized Node.js application will not only perform better but also scale efficiently, ensuring a smooth user 
        experience and reducing operational costs. Regular memory profiling and garbage collection tuning should be part of every 
        production deployment to maintain long-term stability.</div>
