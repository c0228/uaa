    <div><i>Memory management is crucial for ensuring a Node.js application runs efficiently in a production environment. 
        A memory leak occurs when allocated memory is not released after it is no longer needed, leading to increased resource 
        consumption and degraded performance over time. Understanding how to detect, debug, and optimize memory usage in Node.js 
        is essential for building scalable and robust applications.</i></div>
    <div className="mtop15p"><h2 className="blog-head"><b>Understanding Memory Leaks in Node.js</b></h2></div>
    <div className="mtop15p">A memory leak in Node.js happens when objects in memory are not properly garbage collected. This leads 
    to continuous memory consumption and can eventually crash an application if the memory limit is exceeded. Common causes of 
    memory leaks include global variables, event listeners, closures, and improper use of caching mechanisms.</div>

    <div>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Global Variables:</b> Unintended global variables persist in memory and are never garbage collected.</li>
            <li><b>Event Listeners:</b> Adding listeners without removing them can result in accumulated memory usage.</li>
            <li><b>Closures:</b> Functions retaining references to variables beyond their necessary lifetime.</li>
            <li><b>Unbounded Caching:</b> Storing data indefinitely in objects like arrays, maps, or Redis.</li>
            <li><b>DOM References (in SSR environments):</b> Retaining references to DOM elements in server-side rendering.</li>
        </ol>
