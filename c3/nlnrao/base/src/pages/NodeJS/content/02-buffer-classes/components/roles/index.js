                <div><b>Initialization</b></div>
                <ul>
                    <li>While Buffer classes themselves are not directly involved in the initialization of Node.js or V8, the 
                    Buffer module is initialized along with other core modules when Node.js starts up. This initialization 
                    process ensures that Buffer classes are available for use throughout the runtime environment.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li className="mtop15p">
                <div><b>Loading Javascript Files</b></div>
                <ul>
                    <li>During the loading of JavaScript files, Buffer classes can be used within the code being loaded.<br/> 
                    For example, if a JavaScript file contains logic for handling binary data, it may create and manipulate 
                    Buffer instances to perform operations such as reading from or writing to files, processing network data, 
                    or interacting with binary protocols.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li className="mtop15p">
                <div><b>Parsing and Compilation</b></div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Buffer classes themselves are not directly involved in the parsing and compilation of JavaScript 
                    code by V8. However, if a JavaScript file being parsed and compiled contains code that creates or 
                    manipulates Buffer instances, V8 will generate optimized machine code to execute those Buffer-related 
                    operations efficiently.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li className="mtop15p">
                <div><b>Execution</b></div>
                <ul>
                    <li>During the execution of JavaScript code by V8, Buffer instances are used to store and manipulate 
                    binary data as needed by the application logic.<br/> For example, if an application is processing incoming 
                    network data or reading from a file, Buffer instances may be created and populated with the received 
                    data for further processing.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li className="mtop15p">
                <div><b>Event Loop</b></div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Buffer instances may be used within asynchronous operations managed by the event loop. For instance, 
                    if an asynchronous I/O operation completes and returns binary data, that data may be stored in a 
                    Buffer instance before being processed further or passed to a callback function.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li className="mtop15p">
                <div><b>Garbage Collection</b></div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Buffer instances, like other objects in JavaScript, are subject to garbage collection by V8 when they 
                    are no longer referenced by the application. V8's garbage collector periodically scans the heap to 
                    reclaim memory occupied by unused Buffer instances and other objects, preventing memory leaks and 
                    optimizing memory usage.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li className="mtop15p">
                <div><b>Native Bindings</b></div>
                <ul>
                    <li>While Buffer classes themselves are implemented in JavaScript, Node.js allows developers to create 
                    native C/C++ bindings using its addon system. These native bindings can interact with Buffer instances 
                    and utilize them to exchange binary data between JavaScript and native code.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li className="mtop15p">
                <div><b>Error Handling</b></div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Buffer classes may be involved in error handling scenarios where binary data processing encounters 
                    errors or exceptions. For example, if there's an error while reading from a file or parsing network data, 
                    Buffer instances may be used to capture and handle the error condition appropriately.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div className="mtop15p">In summary, Buffer classes are used throughout various stages of the Node.js runtime environment, 
    primarily during the loading of JavaScript files, execution of application logic, and handling of binary data in I/O 
    operations.</div>
