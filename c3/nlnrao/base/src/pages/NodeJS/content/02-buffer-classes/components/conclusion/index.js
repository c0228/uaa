    <div className="mtop15p">Buffer classes in Node.js provide a powerful way to handle binary data efficiently, especially when 
        dealing with file systems, network streams, or cryptographic operations. Unlike regular JavaScript strings, Buffers allow 
        direct manipulation of raw memory, making them essential for performance-critical applications.<br/><br/>
        By offering methods for reading, writing, slicing, and converting data, Buffers enable seamless handling of different data 
        formats. Understanding how to create, allocate, and modify Buffers is crucial for optimizing performance in Node.js 
        applications, particularly when working with large datasets or real-time data processing.</div>
