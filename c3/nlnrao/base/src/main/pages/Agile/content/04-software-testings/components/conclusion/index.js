   <div className="mtop5p">Software testing has evolved into one of the most essential parts of modern software development. From simple manual tests 
      to advanced automation frameworks, testing ensures reliability, performance, and user satisfaction.</div>
   <div className="mtop5p">Every type of testing serves a unique purpose. When combined, they help deliver software that is stable, secure, and ready 
      for real-world use. As systems grow more complex, the future of testing will continue to expand — embracing AI-based testing, 
      self-healing automation, and intelligent defect prediction.</div>
