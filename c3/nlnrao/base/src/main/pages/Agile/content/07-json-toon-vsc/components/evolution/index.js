   <div className="mtop15p">
      <div>Data formats have quietly become the backbone of every modern software system—from APIs to ML engines to 
         microservices. Over the years, we’ve watched them evolve from heavy, verbose structures to lightweight, flexible, 
         and highly modular systems.</div>
      <div>In this blog, we’ll explore four such formats — <b>XML, JSON, TOON, and VSC</b> — their examples, use-cases, and how to load 
         them in Python.</div>
