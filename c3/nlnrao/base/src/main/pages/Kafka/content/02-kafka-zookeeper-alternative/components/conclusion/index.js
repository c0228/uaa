    <div className="mbot15p">Raft offers a promising alternative to Zookeeper for Kafka’s consensus needs. It can potentially improve performance, 
        fault tolerance, and scalability while simplifying cluster management. However, migrating to Raft requires careful 
        planning, testing, and adoption by the Kafka community. With ongoing improvements in Kafka’s architecture (such as 
        KIP-500), Raft could become the future consensus algorithm powering Kafka clusters.</div>
