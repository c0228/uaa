    <div className="mtop15p mbot15p">Polyglot persistence is a powerful strategy that enables developers to select 
      the most suitable database for each aspect of a distributed system. Understanding the strengths and trade-offs 
      of SQL, NoSQL, and NewSQL helps in making informed decisions based on consistency, performance, and complexity 
      requirements.<br/><br/>
      By carefully balancing these factors, modern architectures can achieve high scalability, data integrity, and 
      performance, ensuring a robust and efficient distributed system.
