    <div className="mtop15p mbot15p">Consensus algorithms are the backbone of reliable distributed systems. Paxos provides 
        strong theoretical guarantees but is complex, while Raft simplifies implementation with similar properties. Multi-Paxos 
        and Zab optimize performance for specific workloads. When choosing an algorithm, consider factors like fault tolerance, 
        scalability, and ease of implementation.<br/><br/>
        For large-scale deployments, optimizing network overhead, handling leader failures efficiently, and ensuring partition 
        tolerance are key challenges. Understanding these trade-offs is essential for designing robust distributed systems.<br/><br/>
        By selecting the right consensus algorithm, you can build resilient, efficient, and scalable distributed applications 
        that meet your specific requirements.</div>
