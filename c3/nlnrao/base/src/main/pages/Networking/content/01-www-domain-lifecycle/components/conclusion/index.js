    <div className="mtop15p mbot15p"><code><b>www.example.com</b></code> is more than just a name—it’s a <b>digital identity</b>, 
    <b>technical configuration</b>, and <b>asset</b> in the global web ecosystem. From its <b>conceptual birth in the 1980s</b>, 
    through the <b>hands of webmasters and developers</b>, to its <b>potential end and rebirth</b>, a domain name lives a full 
    lifecycle governed by policies, protocols, and innovation.<br/>
    As the internet continues to evolve—with <b>decentralized domains</b>, <b>AI DNS</b>, and <b>security-first protocols</b> - 
    our digital naming system will also keep transforming. Understanding how it works empowers individuals and businesses to better 
    manage their presence online.</div>
