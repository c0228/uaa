    <div className="mtop15p">Two-tiered caching is a powerful strategy in modern computing. It 
    balances <b>speed</b>, <b>scalability</b> and <b>cost</b> by leveraging multiple layers of cache, each tailored to different 
    data access patterns. By intelligently designing eviction policies for each tier, systems can serve data more efficiently, 
    reduce database load, and ultimately offer a smoother experience for users.</div>
    <div className="mtop15p">As applications grow in complexity and scale, two-tiered caching is no longer a luxury — it’s a necessity. 
    Implementing it wisely can mean the difference between a system that lags and a system that leads.</div>
