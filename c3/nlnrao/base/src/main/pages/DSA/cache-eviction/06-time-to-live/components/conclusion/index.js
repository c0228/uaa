    <div className="mtop15p"><b>Time to Live (TTL)</b> offers a lightweight, deterministic approach to cache eviction. It helps 
    keep data fresh and memory usage in check without requiring elaborate data access tracking or frequency monitoring. While it
     may not be optimal for every use case—especially those needing highly dynamic data access patterns—it’s ideal for systems 
     where <b>data staleness is predictable</b> and <b>simple expiry is sufficient</b>.</div>
    <div className="mtop15p">Whether you're building a personal web application or architecting a distributed enterprise solution, 
        TTL remains a <b>foundational strategy</b> worth understanding and using wisely.</div>
 </div>);
