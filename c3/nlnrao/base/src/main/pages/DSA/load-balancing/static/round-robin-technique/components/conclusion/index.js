    <div className="mtop15p">The <b>Round Robin load balancing algorithm</b> is a great choice for evenly distributing traffic 
    across multiple servers in a simple, cyclical manner. It's fast, efficient, and works best in <b>homogeneous environments</b> where 
    all servers have roughly equal capacity.</div>
    <div className="mtop15p">However, for <b>heterogeneous systems</b> or when performance and traffic vary, other algorithms 
    like <b>Least Connections</b> or <b>IP Hashing</b> may be more effective.</div>
    <div className="mtop15p">Implementing Round Robin is also a good starting point for learning more advanced load balancing techniques.</div>
