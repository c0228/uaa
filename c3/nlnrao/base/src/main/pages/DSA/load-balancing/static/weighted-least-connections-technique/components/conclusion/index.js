      <div>Weighted Least Connections is especially useful when:</div>
      <div>
         <ul>
            <li className="mtop5p">Servers are <b>not equal in capacity</b> — some have more CPU, RAM, or network bandwidth.</li>
            <li className="mtop5p">You need to <b>optimize throughput and responsiveness</b> across mixed hardware.</li>
            <li className="mtop5p">Your workloads are <b>long-lived connections</b>, e.g., API calls, database sessions, or video 
            streams.</li>

    <div className="mtop15p"><b>Weighted Least Connections</b> is a powerful load balancing algorithm that combines real-time 
    server load with predefined server capabilities. It's particularly effective in environments with heterogeneous 
    resources — such as cloud environments or containerized apps — ensuring high availability, fair resource usage, and 
    minimal latency.</div>
    <div className="mtop15p">Whether you’re building a scalable backend for a startup or optimizing enterprise-grade APIs, 
      mastering this algorithm will help you unlock smarter and more efficient load distribution strategies.</div>
