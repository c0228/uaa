   In today’s fast-paced web world, users expect lightning-fast responses from websites and applications. Whether you're 
   streaming a video, shopping online, or using cloud applications, efficient <b>load balancing</b> plays a crucial role in 
   ensuring smooth delivery. Among various strategies, the <b>Least Connections</b> algorithm stands out in dynamic environments 
   where requests vary in execution time and resources. Let’s dive deep into this algorithm to understand how it works and how 
   you can implement it.

   <div className="mtop15p"><h2 className="blog-head"><b>Introduction</b></h2></div>
   <div className="mtop15p"><b>Load balancing</b> refers to the process of distributing incoming network traffic across multiple 
   servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed. This improves responsiveness and increases availability.</div>

   <div className="mtop15p"><h4 className="blog-head"><b>What is the Least Connections Technique?</b></h4></div>
   <div className="mtop15p">
      <div>The <b>Least Connections</b> algorithm dynamically selects the server with the fewest active connections at the time 
      of the incoming request. It is ideal in environments where the time to process each request can vary widely, such as in:</div>
      <div className="mtop15p">
         <ul>
            <li>API gateways</li>
            <li>Video streaming platforms</li>
            <li>E-commerce websites during sales events</li>
         </ul>
      </div>
      <div>Unlike <b>Round Robin</b>, which distributes traffic evenly regardless of server load, Least Connections 
      considers <b>real-time</b> server workload, offering better adaptability.</div>
   </div>

   <div className="mtop15p"><h4 className="blog-head"><b>How Least Connections Works?</b></h4></div>
   <div>
      <ol>
         <li className="mtop5p">Each server maintains a count of current active connections.</li>
         <li className="mtop5p">When a new request arrives, the load balancer inspects all servers.</li>
         <li className="mtop5p">The server with the <b>least number of active connections</b> is selected.</li>
         <li className="mtop5p">The connection count is incremented for that server.</li>
         <li className="mtop5p">Once a request completes, the connection count is decremented.</li>
      </ol>
   </div>
   <div className="mtop5p">This technique assumes:</div>
   <div>
      <ul>
         <li className="mtop5p">All servers have equal capacity (unless weighted versions are used).</li>
         <li className="mtop5p">Connection tracking is available and accurate.</li>
      </ul>
   </div>
 </div>);
