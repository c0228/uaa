   <div className="mtop15p"><b>Resource-Based Load Balancing</b> offers a smarter and more realistic way to distribute 
   workloads, especially in heterogeneous environments where server capabilities differ. While it may require more effort 
   to monitor and update resource metrics in real-time, the benefits in terms of performance stability, fault tolerance, 
   and user satisfaction make it a compelling choice.</div>

         <li className="mtop5p">Resource-Based Load Balancing considers real-time server metrics (CPU, memory, etc.).</li>
         <li className="mtop5p">It routes traffic to the most capable server at the moment.</li>
         <li className="mtop5p">Implementation involves monitoring agents and dynamic scoring.</li>
         <li className="mtop5p">Great for environments with non-uniform server hardware/software.</li>
