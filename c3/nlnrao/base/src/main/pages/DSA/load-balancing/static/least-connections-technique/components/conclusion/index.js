    <div className="mtop15p">The <b>Least Connections technique</b> offers an intelligent way to distribute traffic, especially 
    in dynamic environments. It provides real-time adaptability that static methods like Round Robin cannot. Though simple to 
    implement, it can be enhanced with server weights or integrated with health checks for more robust production systems.</div>
    <div className="mtop15p">If youâ€™re building a backend system, cloud service, or an enterprise-grade API, considering 
      Least Connections as your load balancing strategy could be the difference between smooth scaling and painful outages.</div>
