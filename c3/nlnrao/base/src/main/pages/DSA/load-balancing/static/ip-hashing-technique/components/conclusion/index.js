      <b>IP Hashing</b> is a lightweight, deterministic load balancing technique that’s perfect for use cases requiring 
      session stickiness. While it's not suitable for every scenario—especially dynamic server pools—it provides a solid 
      foundation for predictable traffic routing.
    </div>
    <div className="mtop15p">It is often used in <b>reverse proxies</b>, <b>CDNs</b> and <b>simple web farms</b>, where 
    performance and simplicity matter. By pairing it with smarter hashing (e.g., consistent hashing), it can scale well for 
    modern cloud-native architectures too.</div>
