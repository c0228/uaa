    <div className="mtop15p">Theta (&Theta;) Notation plays a crucial role in understanding an algorithm's true complexity. 
        While Big-O is great for setting performance ceilings, and Omega for floors, <b>Theta bridges the two by giving a precise 
        measure</b> — like saying, "this is how long it will really take under normal conditions."</div>
    <div className="mtop15p">When you’re serious about performance, especially in competitive programming or system 
        design, <b>Theta notation helps you look beyond the extremes and focus on the average-case behavior</b>. It promotes 
        smarter, data-driven decisions in algorithm selection and optimization.</div>
