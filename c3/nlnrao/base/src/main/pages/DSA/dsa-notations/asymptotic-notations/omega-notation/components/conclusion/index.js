    <div className="mtop15p">
        <div>While many programmers focus solely on <b>Big-O</b>, <b>Omega Notation</b> plays a critical role in giving 
        us <b>realistic expectations</b> of algorithm behavior. It highlights 
        the <b>minimum time or space an algorithm will take</b>, even in the best-case scenario. When evaluating or comparing 
        algorithms, especially when analyzing optimizations, Omega Notation reminds us of the <b>floor</b> â€” the 
        point <b>below which no improvement is possible</b>.</div>
    </div>
    <div className="mtop15p">By understanding and using <b>&Omega; Notation</b>, you equip yourself with 
    a <b>more complete picture of algorithm performance</b>, which is essential not only for acing technical interviews but also 
    for writing efficient and reliable code in the real world.</div>
