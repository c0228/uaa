    <div className="mtop15p">The <b>Gossip Protocol</b> is a simple yet powerful method for spreading information across 
    distributed systems. Inspired by how rumors spread in real life, gossip-based protocols 
    offer <b>scalability</b>, <b>reliability</b>, and <b>fault tolerance</b> — all critical features in systems like 
    blockchains, distributed databases, and microservices.</div>
    <div className="mtop15p">While it doesn’t guarantee instant 
    consistency, <b>eventual consistency is often good enough</b> — and the protocol’s simplicity and robustness make 
    it a favorite in modern distributed architecture.</div>
