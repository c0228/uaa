      <div>The <b>Paxos Algorithm</b> solves one of the most complex problems in distributed 
      systems â€” <b>achieving reliable consensus</b> despite failures and delays. While it is theoretically elegant and robust, 
      its <b>complexity has led to alternative algorithms</b> like <b>Raft</b> that are more practical for implementation and 
      understanding.</div>
      <div>Yet, Paxos remains a <b>foundational pillar</b> in distributed computing. Its real-world usage in systems 
      like <code><b>Google's Chubby</b></code> shows its power in mission-critical infrastructure.</div>
