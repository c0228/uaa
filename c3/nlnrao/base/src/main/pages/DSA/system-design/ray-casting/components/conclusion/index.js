   <div className="mtop15p"><b>Ray Casting</b> is a fundamental tool in system design where visibility, detection, and 
    simulation are key. It powers critical decisions in rendering, real-time interaction, and perception algorithms across 
    domains. Though conceptually simple, its applications are profound — from video games to robotics, architectural design 
    to autonomous systems.</div>
   <div className="mtop15p">Understanding how rays travel, intersect, and provide information about their environment equips 
   developers with a superpower — the ability to see what the system sees.</div>
