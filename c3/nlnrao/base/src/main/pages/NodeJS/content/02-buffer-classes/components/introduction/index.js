    <div><i>In Node.js, a buffer is a temporary storage space for binary data that is being moved from one place to another. 
    It's particularly useful when dealing with binary data such as images, audio files, network packets, or when 
    interfacing with binary-heavy protocols like TCP sockets.<br/><br/>
    Buffer classes in Node.js are used to handle binary data directly. They are a way to work with arrays of integers 
    representing raw binary data. They provide a way to work with raw memory allocated outside the V8 heap. Buffer instances 
    can be created in various ways: by providing the length of the buffer, an array of octets, or a string. They offer methods 
    to manipulate and convert data, making them crucial for tasks like reading/writing files, handling network data, and 
    cryptographic operations.</i></div>
