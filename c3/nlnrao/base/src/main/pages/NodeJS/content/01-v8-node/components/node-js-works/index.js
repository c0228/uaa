              <ol>
                <li>
                    <div><b>Initialization</b></div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When Node.js starts, it initializes the V8 engine. This involves setting up the JavaScript runtime environment, 
                            which includes creating the global object, setting up the global scope, and allocating memory for V8's internal 
                            data structures.</li>
                        <li>V8's initialization process also includes configuring various runtime settings, such as memory limits, stack size, 
                            and garbage collection parameters.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li className="mtop15p">
                    <div><b>Loading JavaScript Files</b></div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Once initialized, Node.js loads the initial JavaScript file specified by the user. This is typically the entry 
                            point of the application, such as index.js or app.js.</li>
                        <li>The loaded JavaScript file is then passed to the V8 engine for execution.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li className="mtop15p">
                    <div><b>Parsing and Compilation</b></div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>As the JavaScript code is read, V8 parses it to create an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The AST represents the 
                            structure of the code, enabling V8 to understand its semantics.</li>
                        <li>After parsing, V8 compiles the AST into machine code using its optimizing compiler. This compilation process 
                            optimizes the code for execution, potentially improving its performance.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li className="mtop15p">
                    <div><b>Execution</b></div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Once compiled, the machine code is executed by the V8 engine. This is where the actual execution of the JavaScript 
                            code takes place, and the tasks defined in the code are performed.</li>
                        <li>V8 handles function calls, variable assignments, control flow statements, and other JavaScript language features 
                            during execution.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li className="mtop15p">
                    <div><b>Event Loop</b></div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Node.js utilizes V8's event loop to manage asynchronous operations. The event loop is a fundamental part of 
                            Node.js's non-blocking I/O model, which allows it to efficiently handle concurrent operations.</li>
                        <li>Asynchronous operations such as file I/O, network requests, and timers are initiated by Node.js and are 
                            managed by the event loop. When these operations complete, their corresponding callbacks are queued in 
                            the event loop to be executed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li className="mtop15p">
                    <div><b>Garbage Collection</b></div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>V8 automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation through garbage collection. Garbage collection 
                            is the process of reclaiming memory that is no longer in use by identifying and freeing up unused memory.</li>
                        <li>V8's garbage collector periodically scans the heap, where objects allocated by JavaScript code are stored, 
                            and identifies objects that are no longer reachable (i.e., not referenced by any part of the program). These 
                            unreachable objects are then removed from memory.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li className="mtop15p">
                    <div><b>Native Bindings</b></div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Node.js allows developers to use native C/C++ bindings through its addon system. These bindings enable 
                            integration with existing C/C++ libraries or provide access to system-level functionality.</li>
                        <li>Node.js addons interface with V8's C++ API to interact with JavaScript code. This allows developers to 
                            leverage the performance and capabilities of native code within their Node.js applications.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li className="mtop15p">
                    <div><b>Error Handling</b></div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>V8 provides mechanisms for handling exceptions and errors in JavaScript code. When an error occurs 
                            during execution, V8 generates an exception object that can be caught and handled by JavaScript code 
                            using constructs like the try...catch statement.</li>
                        <li>Node.js also provides its own error handling mechanisms, such as the process.on('uncaughtException') 
                            event, which allows developers to capture and handle uncaught exceptions at the application level.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
              </ol>

              These steps collectively describe how Node.js interacts with the V8 engine to execute JavaScript code and provide a 
              runtime environment for building server-side applications. Each step plays a crucial role in ensuring the proper 
              functioning and performance of Node.js applications.
