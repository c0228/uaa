    <div className="mtop15p mbot15p">Kubernetes plays a crucial role in edge computing by enabling scalable, resilient, and automated 
        application management. However, challenges such as resource limitations, network reliability, security, and operational 
        complexity must be addressed. Solutions like KubeEdge and MicroK8s provide practical approaches to overcoming these 
        challenges, making Kubernetes a viable option for edge deployments. As edge computing continues to evolve, Kubernetes-based 
        solutions will become more refined, further enhancing the capabilities of distributed applications.</div>
