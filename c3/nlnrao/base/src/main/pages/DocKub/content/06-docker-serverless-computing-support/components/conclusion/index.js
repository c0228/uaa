    <div className="mbot15p">Kubernetes is a powerful platform for running serverless workloads, and frameworks like Knative 
        and OpenFaaS make it possible to deploy serverless applications efficiently. Knative is best suited for enterprise-grade 
        serverless solutions with built-in scaling and event-driven processing, while OpenFaaS provides a simpler and more 
        lightweight alternative for developers who need a flexible serverless solution. Understanding the strengths and 
        limitations of these frameworks allows organizations to build scalable and cost-effective serverless architectures 
        on Kubernetes.</div>
