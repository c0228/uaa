   <div className="mtop15p">Java has continuously evolved since its inception in 1995, shaping the modern programming 
      landscape with its robustness, portability, and security. Each version of Java has introduced groundbreaking features, 
      from <b>basic object-oriented principles in Java 1.0</b> to <b>modularization in Java 9</b> and <b>performance 
      improvements in Java 17 and beyond</b>.</div>
   <div className="mtop15p"><h4><b>Key Takeaways:</b></h4></div>
   <div className="mtop15p">
      <ul>
         <li><b>Early Java (1.0 - 1.4):</b> Focused on core language features, AWT, Swing, and JVM enhancements.</li>
         <li><b>Java 5 - 8:</b> Introduced major programming advancements like Generics, Lambdas, Streams, and the functional paradigm.</li>
         <li><b>Java 9 - 17:</b> Shifted to a six-month release cycle, bringing modularization, pattern matching, and record classes.</li>
         <li><b>Java 18 -</b> Present: Continued innovation with AI-driven optimizations, incubator/preview features, and improved security.</li>
      </ul>
   </div>
   <div className="mtop15p mbot15p">Java remains one of the most widely used and actively developed programming languages. With each release, 
      it adapts to modern computing trends, ensuring developers have access to cutting-edge tools and frameworks.
      With Java's predictable release schedule, future versions will continue refining its performance, security, and scalability, reinforcing 
      its position as a dominant force in enterprise and cloud computing.</div>
