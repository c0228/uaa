   <div className="mtop15p">The <b>Smart Contract Lifecycle</b> is not just about writing some Solidity code and deploying it. It's a carefully planned 
   sequence of <b>design</b>, <b>test</b>, <b>deploy</b>, <b>interact</b> and <b>optionally upgrade</b> or <b>retire</b> the contract. 
   Each phase is critical to ensuring that smart contracts are secure, performant, and maintainable.</div>
   <div className="mtop15p mbot15p">As <b>Web 3.0</b> continues to reshape how we think about applications, finance, identity, and 
   governance, understanding this lifecycle becomes essential for developers, auditors, and even investors. By combining 
   frontend frameworks like <b>React</b>, <b>Angular</b> and <b>Vue</b> with blockchain backends, we create truly decentralized, 
   interactive dApps that users can trust.</div>
