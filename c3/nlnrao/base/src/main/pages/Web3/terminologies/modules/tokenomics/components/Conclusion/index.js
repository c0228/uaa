   <div className="mtop15p">Tokenomics isn't just a technical term — it’s the <b>lifeblood of decentralized ecosystems</b>. It 
   dictates how people interact, earn, govern, and contribute. For developers, good tokenomics ensures adoption and sustainability. 
   For users and investors, it’s about trust and utility.</div>
   <div className="mtop15p">As we build the future of the web — fairer, decentralized, and user-owned — tokenomics is the engine 
   that drives it.</div>
