   <div className="mtop15p">Web 3 browsers are the new interface to the decentralized internet. They don’t just display web 
   pages — they empower users to take back control of their data, identity, and digital assets. As Web 3.0 grows, these browsers 
   will be at the forefront—ushering in a new era of privacy, ownership, and decentralization.</div> 
   <div className="mtop15p">Whether you're a developer building dApps or a user exploring the decentralized world, switching 
   to a Web 3 browser is your first step into the next generation of the internet.</div>
