      At the heart of this revolution lies <b>blockchain technology</b>. But not all blockchains are built the same. One key 
      distinction that shapes how blockchain networks operate is whether they are <b>public</b> or <b>private</b>. Understanding 
      this difference is critical for developers, businesses, and enthusiasts navigating the Web3 space.</i></div>

   <div className="mtop15p">A <b>public blockchain</b> is a <b>decentralized network</b> that anyone can join and participate 
   in. These are <b>permissionless</b>, meaning no one controls who can access or validate transactions. Examples 
   include <b>Bitcoin</b>, <b>Ethereum</b>, and <b>Polkadot</b>.</div>
   <div className="mtop15p">In contrast, a <b>private blockchain</b> is <b>permissioned</b>, meaning only certain participants 
   are allowed to access the network. These are typically used by organizations for internal operations, offering more control 
   over data and access. Examples include <b>Hyperledger Fabric</b>, <b>R3 Corda</b> and <b>Quorum</b>.</div>
   <div className="mtop15p">Letâ€™s dive deeper into the <b>differences</b>, <b>use cases</b>, and how to interact with them 
   using modern JavaScript frameworks.</div>
