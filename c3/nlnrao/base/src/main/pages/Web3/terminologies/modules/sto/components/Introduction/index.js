    <div className="mtop15p"><i>In the world of traditional finance, investment opportunities like stocks, bonds, or real estate 
    are often limited by geography, paperwork, and third-party intermediaries. With the advent of blockchain, <b>Web 3.0</b> has 
    introduced new ways to <b>digitize real-world assets</b> and tokenize ownership. Among 
    these, <b>Security Token Offerings (STOs)</b> have emerged as a regulatory-compliant and secure way to raise capital by offering 
    tokenized securities on the blockchain.</i></div>

    <div className="mtop15p">A <b>Security Token Offering (STO)</b> is a <b>regulated fundraising method</b> where blockchain-based 
    tokens are issued to represent <b>ownership rights in real-world assets</b>, such as equity, debt, or real estate. Unlike Initial 
    Coin Offerings (ICOs), which often bypass regulation, STOs are <b>governed by securities laws</b> in their respective 
    jurisdictions (like the SEC in the U.S.).</div>
