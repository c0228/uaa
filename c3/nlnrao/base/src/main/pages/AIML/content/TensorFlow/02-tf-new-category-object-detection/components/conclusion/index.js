    <div className="mtop15p mbot15p">Few-shot object detection presents a promising avenue for enabling models to learn from limited data, 
    closely aligning with human learning capabilities. By integrating transfer learning and meta-learning techniques within TensorFlow, 
    practitioners can develop models that generalize well to new categories with minimal labeled examples. While challenges like data 
    scarcity and computational demands persist, ongoing research and advancements in model architectures and training strategies continue 
    to push the boundaries of what's achievable in FSOD.</div>
