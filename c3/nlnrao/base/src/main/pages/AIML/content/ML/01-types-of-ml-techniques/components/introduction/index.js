    <div className="mtop15p">Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to 
      learn patterns from data and make decisions without explicit programming. It is widely used in fields such as 
      finance, healthcare, automation, and more. ML is broadly categorized into three main types:</div>
      <div className="mtop15p">
         <ol>
            <li><b>Supervised Learning</b></li>
            <li><b>Unsupervised Learning</b></li>
            <li><b>Reinforcement Learning</b></li>
         </ol>
      </div>
      <div>Each of these techniques has different use cases and is suited for different types of data problems. This blog 
         explores these categories in detail with Python code examples.</div>
