   <div className="mtop15p">The <b>NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU</b> bridges the gap between high-performance AI training GPUs and cost-efficient 
      inference hardware. With its <b>Turing Tensor Cores, low power usage, and cloud-friendly design,</b> it has become a standard 
      for <b>AI inference in production.</b></div>
   <div className="mtop15p">Whether you are building <b>chatbots, recommendation systems, or computer vision applications,</b> the T4 
      provides a <b>scalable and budget-friendly solution.</b> It represents how AI hardware evolved from graphics acceleration to powering 
      the intelligence behind the apps we use daily.</div>
   <div className="mtop15p">In short, the <b>Tesla T4 democratized AI inference,</b> making powerful machine learning accessible to businesses 
      and developers worldwide.</div>
