   <h3><b>Testing React/React Native Components: Ensuring Functionality in Your Application</b></h3>
   <div>Explore various testing methods to ensure your React / React Native individual component is stable and functioning correctly within your application.</div>
   <div>
    One technology that can handle various types of testing for both React and React Native applications is <b>Jest</b>.
	It is a popular JavaScript testing framework maintained by Facebook, and it's highly suitable for testing React and React Native components.
    Here are some types of testing, we can perform on React / React Native component, when we create:</div>
	<div>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Unit Testing:</b> Unit tests focus on testing individual units or functions of your component in isolation.</li>
		<li><b>Snapshot Testing:</b> Snapshot testing captures a snapshot of the component's rendered output and compares it against a 
		saved reference snapshot. This helps detect unintended changes in the UI.</li>
		<li><b>Integration Testing:</b> Integration tests verify that different parts of your application work together correctly. These 
		tools allow you to simulate user interactions and test how your components interact with each other.</li>
		<li><b>End-to-End Testing (E2E):</b> E2E tests simulate real user scenarios by interacting with your application as a whole. These tests 
		usually involve launching the app in a simulator or on a device and automating user interactions to validate the behavior of your components.</li>
		<li><b>Accessibility Testing:</b> Accessibility testing ensures that your components are usable by people with disabilities. These tools can help 
		identify accessibility issues such as missing labels, improper focus handling, or non-accessible gestures.</li>
		<li><b>Performance Testing:</b> Performance testing evaluates the responsiveness and efficiency of your components under different conditions.</li>
	</ol>
	By implementing a combination of these automation testing techniques, you can ensure the reliability and quality of your React / React Native components, 
	leading to a better overall user experience for our web / mobile application.<br/><br/>
